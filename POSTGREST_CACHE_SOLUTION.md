# PostgREST Cache Issue - Solution

## 🔍 Problem Identified

After 12+ hours, PostgREST's schema cache still hasn't refreshed. This is preventing the Supabase JavaScript client from seeing new columns (`chunk_layer`, `parent_chunk_id`, `extracted_facts`).

**Root Cause:** Supabase's PostgREST layer caches database schema, and the cache refresh can be extremely persistent in some cases.

## ✅ Solution: Bypass PostgREST with PostgreSQL Function

Instead of using the Supabase client (which relies on PostgREST), we now use a **direct PostgreSQL function** that bypasses the cache entirely.

### What Was Changed:

1. **Created PostgreSQL Function** (`CREATE_INSERT_CHUNKS_FUNCTION.sql`)
   - Function: `insert_document_chunks_batch()`
   - Accepts chunks as JSON
   - Inserts directly using SQL (bypasses PostgREST)
   - Includes ALL columns (chunk_layer, parent_chunk_id, extracted_facts)

2. **Updated VectorStorageService** 
   - Changed from: `db.from('document_chunks').insert()`
   - Changed to: `db.rpc('insert_document_chunks_batch', { chunks_json })`
   - Now bypasses PostgREST cache completely

### Benefits:

✅ **Zero functionality loss** - ALL advanced features work (dual-layer, fact extraction)  
✅ **Works immediately** - No waiting for cache refresh  
✅ **Future-proof** - When PostgREST cache eventually refreshes, everything continues to work  
✅ **Clean solution** - Uses standard PostgreSQL features  

## 📋 Steps to Deploy:

### Step 1: Create the PostgreSQL Function
Run `CREATE_INSERT_CHUNKS_FUNCTION.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE:  ✅ Function created successfully! Inserted 1 chunks
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend
```bash
cd /Users/govarthanane/Documents/Arya-rag/packages/backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Document Upload
Upload a document and verify it processes successfully.

## 🧪 Verification:

After deployment, you can verify everything works:

1. **Upload a document** - Should process to 100%
2. **Check database** - Should see chunks with `chunk_layer`, `parent_chunk_id`, `extracted_facts`
3. **Search** - Should return results with all advanced features

## 📊 What Happens Later:

When PostgREST's cache eventually refreshes (hours or days later):
- Nothing breaks
- The function continues to work
- No code changes needed
- System continues operating normally

## 🎯 Summary:

**Before:** Supabase Client → PostgREST (cached schema) → PostgreSQL ❌  
**After:** Supabase Client → PostgreSQL Function → Direct Insert ✅  

This solution maintains ALL advanced functionality while bypassing the problematic cache layer.
